# Baseball Statistics
## Project Objectives
The project has the following two objectives.
1.	Determine if baseball teams are more successful with high offenses, tight defenses or a balance of the two over multiple time periods based on correlation analysis. Determine the main style of play (offensive, defensive or balanced) in each time period
   
  &nbsp;a.	Period 1 â€“ before 1920
  
  &nbsp;b.	Period 2 - 1920 to 1959
  
  &nbsp;c.	Period 3 - 1960 to 1989
  
  &nbsp;d.	Period 4 - 1990 to 2010
  
3.	Develop a predictive model using linear regression for data in period 4 that can predict the number of games a team is expected to win.
